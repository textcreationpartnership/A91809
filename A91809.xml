            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR your Anſwer to this my <hi>Firſt Queare,</hi> which you affirme <hi>ſeemes to import</hi> thus much, <hi>that from ſuch Congregations where the word and ſacraments are purely diſpenſed, men ought not to ſeperate, but that men are, and ought to ſeperate from ſuch, where the word and ſacraments are not purely diſpenſed,</hi> It is well you uſed that evaſion <hi>(ſeemes)</hi> which you doe twice in one ſentence <hi>(yet many things ſeemes to be, which are not:)</hi> And if I ſhould take the advantadge of falling upon every paſſage of your diſcourſe, I might ſhew you how my Queare in many reſpects though it doth impley as in the caſe of our Church the unlawfulnes of all Seperation from out Congregations where the Word and Sacraments are purely diſpenſed, yet it doth not impley, that men are, and ought for to ſeperate from ſuch a Church where the word and Sacraments are not ſo purely diſpenſed, becauſe there are <hi>differant degrees of purity and reformation of Churches,</hi> and whileſt the Word and the Sacraments are diſpenſed according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>for the maine</hi> though there may not in ſome <hi>Axedentalls</hi> and <hi>Cercumſtances</hi> and <hi>Concometents</hi> be that pureneſſe which ought to be, and is deſired; Yet to ſeperate from ſuch Churches, hath neither ground in the Word, nor the approved Iudgement of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113184:4"/>godly and learned Devines: Yea further, a Church may come to be ſo corrupted as that <hi>the Word and the Sacraments in ſomethings of Subſtance may be corrupted, and yet it is not lawfull for men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſeperate:</hi> There is ſomething elſe to be done before they leave ſuch a Church, for they ought to try and uſe all meanes and ways to ſée if the Church may not be healed. In this kinde I could give you many inſtances of the unlawfullneſſe of a ſudden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from a corrupted Church; God will not have his people come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> untill they have uſed all meanes to heale her, as is evident, <hi>51. Jeremiah, verſe 9. Wee would have healed Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, but ſhe is not healed: Forſake her, and let us go every one into his own Country.</hi> Which ſhewes <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt not be left till firſt meanes habe been uſed for her healing: And if you had read aney thing in this point, you would know that as there is an <hi>unjuſt</hi> and an <hi>un-neſſeſſary Seperation</hi> which is upon <hi>leight</hi> and <hi>ſmall cauſes,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>raſh and unadviſed ſeperation</hi> in forſaking a Church <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi> and willingly <hi>without wayting in the uſe of all meanes for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> but I ſhall ſpare to ſpeake further of this, and now come to ſpeak to the maine of your diſcourſe to this my <hi>firſt Queare</hi> nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew <hi>our Congregations are ſuch as where the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are purely diſpenſed,</hi> and then according to your own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you <hi>ſin</hi> and are <hi>juſtly charged with Schiſm</hi> for Seperating from us: All the Scriptures that are coated by you in the beginning of your diſcourſe, and the cloſe to this <hi>Queare</hi> doe none of them in the leaſt prove the Seperation from ſuch a Church as ours is, where there is a <hi>profeſſion of the true Faith</hi> the moſt <hi>eſſentiall noate</hi> of a viſible Church, as is confeſſed not onely by great reformed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but even by ſome Seperatiſts themſelves, as <hi>Mr. Robinſon,</hi> and we have alſo the <hi>Word of God powerfully preached, profeſsed, and maintained, and the right adminiſtration of the two Sacraments.</hi> As for your Scriptures, they onely prove a lawfull Seperation from <hi>Heathen Idolators,</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheming Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian Idolators, Familiar and volentary unneceſſary private ſociety with wicked men,</hi> or the <hi>caſting out of evill men by thoſe that have the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Church:</hi> And if you look over the Scriptures again (and God give you grace to conſider) you will finde all this to be true, as for thoſe grounds by which you would prove that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not purely diſpenſed amongſt us, and ſo you may low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113184:5"/>Seperate from us, namely <hi>in regard that wicked perſons are admitted and ſuffered amongſt us, to come to the Lords Table, and that Children are Baptized amongſt us;</hi> I anſwer theſe are noe grounds, and I dare challenge you and all the Anabaptiſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of your <hi>way</hi> to bring any Scripture wherein you have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or example to Seperate from a Church for ſome wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mingled with good, or becauſe Baptiſme is adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: Is any man ſo ignorant as to deny the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be a true Church? Yet I ſay there was wanting Diſcipline, and more horible abuſes of the Sacraments, and many vicious perſons uncaſt out, <hi>1. Cor. 5.1, 2.</hi> &amp; <hi>1. Cor. 11.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.30. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 1. Cor. 15.12.</hi> with the <hi>2. Cor. 12.20, 21.</hi> Yet <hi>Paul</hi> writes to them as a <hi>true Church.</hi> Many ſuch inſtances I could give you, as alſo that of the <hi>Iſraellites</hi> where there wanted Diſcipline, and the Ordinances moſt groſſely abuſed, yet we account of them to have béene <hi>a true Church, 1. Sam. 2.16, 17.22.29.</hi> And in this caſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of many looſe and uncleane perſons, and yet in many of his Epiſtles, though he blames the not caſting out of ſuch, yet he blames not thoſe that continued in the Church with ſuch; and in all his Exhortations about <hi>purging out the old Leaven</hi> &amp; <hi>putting away the wicked perſons from among them,</hi> never exhorts private perſons in caſe his Apoſtallicall commands were not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that then they ſhould Seperate; and in particular he gives not any directions to the <hi>houſe of Cloe</hi> to Seperate from the Church, although they had made their addreſſe to the Apoſtle, <hi>1. Cor. 1.11.</hi> And <hi>for our Baptizing of Children</hi> which in ſcorn you call <hi>one of the great Sacraments amongſt us;</hi> Know we have ground in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our practiſes therein, and do not go into the <hi>durty pudle of mens Inventions</hi> (as you ſay) but from the Covenant made to belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Gen. 17.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</hi> with <hi>Acts 7.8.</hi> and <hi>Rom. 4.11.</hi> alſo <hi>Levit. 12.3.</hi> with <hi>Luke, 2.21.</hi> and <hi>1.
